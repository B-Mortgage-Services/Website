## What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files stored on your device when you visit a website. They help the site remember your preferences and understand how it is used. We also use browser session storage, which works similarly but is cleared when you close your browser.

## Cookies We Use

### Essential Cookies

These cookies are required for basic site functionality and cannot be disabled.

| Cookie | Purpose | Duration |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `bms_consent` | Remembers your cookie consent preference (accepted or declined) | 365 days |

### Analytics Cookies (require your consent)

These cookies help us understand how visitors use our tools. They are only set if you click **Accept** on the cookie banner.

| Cookie | Purpose | Duration |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `bms_vid` | An anonymous visitor ID (random UUID) that links your page views and tool usage into a single visit history. Contains no personal information. | 180 days |
| `bms_ref` | Stores a token from email campaign links so we can connect your visit to a campaign. Set only when you arrive via a link in one of our emails. | 180 days |

### Session Storage (not cookies)

These are cleared automatically when you close your browser. They do not persist across sessions.

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `bms_sid` | An anonymous session ID used to group page views within a single visit |
| `bms_utm_source` | Marketing attribution — which channel brought you here |
| `bms_utm_medium` | Marketing attribution — the type of link (e.g. email, social) |
| `bms_utm_campaign` | Marketing attribution — the specific campaign name |
| `bms_affordability_data` | Temporarily stores your affordability calculator inputs so they can pre-fill the wellness assessment (expires after 30 minutes) |

## How to Manage Cookies

You can change your cookie preferences at any time by clicking **Manage Cookies** in our website footer. You can also delete cookies through your browser settings:

- **Chrome:** Settings > Privacy and Security > Cookies
- **Firefox:** Settings > Privacy & Security > Cookies and Site Data
- **Safari:** Preferences > Privacy > Manage Website Data
- **Edge:** Settings > Cookies and Site Permissions

## What Happens If You Decline Cookies

If you decline cookies, our tools still work normally:

- The Affordability Calculator, Budget Planner, Protection Shortfall Calculator, and Financial Wellness Assessment all function as usual
- Your tool results will **not** be saved to our database
- If you later submit a contact form, we will not be able to link your enquiry to any previous tool usage on the site
- You can change your mind at any time using the **Manage Cookies** link in the footer

## Data Retention

Anonymous visitor activity data is retained for **12 months** and then automatically deleted. This data contains no personal information — only page URLs, tool result summaries, and anonymous IDs.
