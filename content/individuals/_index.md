  title: "Frequently Asked Questions"
  items:
    - question: "How much deposit do I really need in 2026?"
      answer: "While 5% deposit mortgages exist, having 10% or 15% opens up access to significantly better interest rates. We can review your savings and help you understand the best tier for your budget."
    - question: "What if I'm self-employed or a contractor?"
      answer: "High street banks can sometimes struggle with complex incomes. We have access to specialist lenders who understand self-employment, using net profit or day rates to calculate your affordability."
    - question: "Do you charge a fee for your advice?"
      answer: "We offer an initial free consultation. If you choose to proceed, our fee structure is always transparent and agreed upfront before any work begins. We'll explain exactly what you'll pay and when."
    - question: "Will checking my eligibility affect my credit score?"
      answer: "No. When we do an initial fact-find, we use a 'soft search' which is visible to you but does not leave a footprint for other lenders to see."
